## What is FOO?

FOO stands for the Forest Observatory Ontology. The term ontology is defined as a collection of related terms and their formal definitions. FOO, therefore, comprises a novel ontology that describes wildlife data generated by remote sensing devices. FOO links
existing ontological resources (e.g., SOSA and BBC wildlife Ontology) from two domains (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT) and Wildlife).
