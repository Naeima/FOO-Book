## What is FOO?

FOO stands for the "Forest Observatory Ontology." In computer science, an ontology is a structured collection of related terms and their formal definitions. FOO is a novel ontology specifically designed to describe wildlife data generated by remote sensing devices. It adopts and integrates existing ontological resources, such as SOSA and the BBC Wildlife Ontology--from two key domains: the Internet of Things (IoT) and wildlife.
