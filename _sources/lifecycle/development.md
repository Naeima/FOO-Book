# FOO Development

We built FOO following the Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology  'Poveda et al.(2022)` .
The ontology development underwent four iterative phases. These phases comprise the following:
(i) Requirements (ii) Implementation (iii) Evaluation, and (iV) Publication. The figure below depicts the
development process life-cycle.
